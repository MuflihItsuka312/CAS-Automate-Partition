### Step-by-Step to Free and Format /dev/vda
1.  Unmount the LVM volume
```
sudo umount /mnt/disk
```
2.  Deactivate the logical volume
```
sudo lvchange -an /dev/vg_combined/lv_combined
```
3. Remove the volume group (if you want to delete it completely)

```
sudo vgremove vg_combined
```
4. remove physical volumes (including /dev/vda1 and /dev/vdb1)
```
sudo pvremove /dev/vda1
sudo pvremove /dev/vdb1
```
5. Now format /dev/vda (you may need to wipe partition first)
If /dev/vda1 still exists:

```
sudo wipefs -a /dev/vda1
```
Then delete it:

```
sudo parted /dev/vda
(parted) rm 1
(parted) quit
```
Then:

```
sudo mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/vda
```
Or repartition first if needed:

```
sudo fdisk /dev/vda
```
